Analyze the page via the front-end, log in and discover all the elements that make it up

== Description ==

Your pages may be feeling a little exposed with Frontend Inspectorâ€¦ 
Anyway you can inspect and analyze your pages in each of their parts, and see in front-end every element that composes the result page: Template, Section, Columns, and every widget. 
Each of them will be reported in a panel similar to the Elementor Navigator to feel like at home. 
You can access specific info for any element, like load time, docs, and many other useful data.
